SunAlmanac (Garmin ConnectIQ) Widget
====================================
Usage instructions


Global View
-----------

SunAlmanac displays sunrise/sunset data in multiple views, which you can
browse through thanks to the SELECT button:
 - Sunrise/Sunset and Day Length (Diff.) view:
   time of sunrise and sunset, i.e. when the center of the solar disk
   passes the horizon, taking into account atmospheric refraction
   AND
   length of the day and difference with the previous day
 - Zenith (Altitude) and Azimuth (Sunrise/Sunset) view:
   time and angular altitude of the sun at its zenith position
   AND
   angular azimuth - corresponding to geographic bearing - where
   the center of solar disk passes the horizon
 - Civil Dawn/Dusk and Nautical Dawn/Dusk view:
   time of civil dawn and dusk, i.e. when the center of the solar disk
   is 6° below the horizon
   AND
   time of nautical dawn and dusk, i.e. when the center of the solar disk
   is 12° below the horizon
 - Astronomical Dawn/Dusk and Ecliptic Longitude/Declination view:
   time of astronomical dawn and dusk, i.e. when the center of the solar
   disk is 18° below the horizon
   AND
   ecliptic longitude and declination (at the time of zenith)
 - Location and Height view:
   name and geographical coordinates of the observer's location, along
   its height (Above Ground Level)


Settings
--------

Enter the Settings menu by pressing the MENU button (long-pressing the UP button).

You may then specify the following settings:
 - Location -> Location Source:
   specify whether to use your current GPS position as location or a preset location
 - Location -> Height:
   specify the observer's height (in meters, Above Ground Level) at the location
 - Location -> Load/Edit/Save/Delete Location:
   load/edit/save/delete preset locations (among a 10 available memory slots)
 - Date/Time -> Date Source:
   specify whether to use your current date or a preset date
 - Date/Time -> Preset Date:
   specify the preset date to use
 - Date/Time -> Timezone
   specify whether to display the Local Time (LT) or Universal Time Coordinates (UTC/Z)
 - Background Color
   specify the background color


WARNING!!! GOTCHAS!!!
---------------------

The ConnectIQ framework contains a BUG that leads to ERRONEOUS Local Time (LT)
data for a (preset) date that has a different Daylight Saving Time (DST) value
as the current date. This does not affect Universal Time Coordinates (UTC/Z) data.

Local Time (LT) data are ALWAYS in respect with your CURRENT location/timezone,
NEVER the one of (preset) alternate location.

Computing solar events data relies on approximations and choices of algorithms
that may not be the same as other sources of such data. This may lead to
differences of one to two minutes, depending on the sources.
