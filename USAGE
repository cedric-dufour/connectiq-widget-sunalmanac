SunAlmanac (Garmin ConnectIQ) Widget
====================================
Usage instructions


Global View
-----------

SunAlmanac displays sunrise/sunset data in multiple views, which you can
browse through thanks to the SELECT button:
 - Sunrise/Sunset and Day Length (Diff.) view:
   time of sunrise and sunset, i.e. when the center of the solar disk
   passes the horizon, taking into account atmospheric refraction
   (aviation SR/SS)
   AND
   length of the day and difference with the previous day
 - Noon/Elevation and Azimuth Sunrise/Sunset view:
   time and angular elevation of the sun at its meridian transit position
   AND
   angular azimuth - corresponding to geographic bearing - where
   the center of solar disk passes the horizon
 - Civil Dawn/Dusk and Nautical Dawn/Dusk view:
   time of civil dawn (start) and dusk (end), i.e. when the center of
   the solar disk is 6° below the horizon
   (aviation HRH*)
   AND
   time of nautical dawn (start) and dusk (end), i.e. when the center of
   the solar disk is 12° below the horizon
 - Astronomical Dawn/Dusk and Ecliptic Longitude/Declination view:
   time of astronomical dawn (start) and dusk (end), i.e. when the center
   of the solar disk is 18° below the horizon
   AND
   ecliptic longitude and declination (at the time of meridian transit)
 - Now Azimuth/Elevation view:
   current time along the current sun angular azimuth and elevation
 - Location and Height view:
   name and geographical coordinates of the observer's location, along
   its height (Above Ground Level)


Settings
--------

Enter the Settings menu by pressing the MENU button (long-pressing the UP button).

You may then specify the following settings:

* Location
  - Location Source:
    specify whether to use your current GPS position as location or a preset location
  - Load/Edit/Save/Delete Location:
    load/edit/save/delete preset locations (among a 100 available memory slots)
  - Height:
    specify the observer's height (in meters, Above Ground Level) at the location

* Date/Time
  - Date Source:
    specify whether to use your current date or a preset date
  - Preset Date:
    specify the preset date to use
  - Timezone
    specify whether to display the Local Time (LT) or Universal Time Coordinates (UTC/Z)

- Background Color:
  specify the background color


WARNING!!! GOTCHAS!!!
---------------------

The ConnectIQ framework contains a BUG that leads to ERRONEOUS Local Time (LT)
data for a (preset) date that has a different Daylight Saving Time (DST) value
as the current date. This does not affect Universal Time Coordinates (UTC/Z) data.

Local Time (LT) data are ALWAYS in respect with your CURRENT location/timezone,
NEVER the one of (preset) alternate location.

Computing solar events data relies on approximations and choices of algorithms
that may not be the same as other sources of such data. This may lead to
differences of one to two minutes, depending on the sources.

SunAlmanac data have been verified against Switzerland Aeronautical Information
Publications (AIP) VFG Guide's dawn/sunrise/sunset/dusk tables (RAC 1-1) for
years 2017 to 2019, leading to:
 - 83% (3620/4380) of data having a 0-minute offset
 - 17% (760/4380) of data having a 1-minute offset
